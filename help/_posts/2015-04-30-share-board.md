Public board might be completely public where anyone can **view** and **edit the board**. Board is completely public until it is accessed by someone who has **logged in** on Sketchboard.io. First logged in user that access the board takes the board ownership.

Anyone can view **owned public boards** as well, but only teammates can edit owned public boards.
