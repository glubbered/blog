We have heard you and linking external web pages or Sketchboard.io boards should be improved.

Markdown Links
--------------

Users have requested markdown shapes to support links. It definitely makes possible to write more rich content.

Open markdown editor by double clicking e.g. a Note shape.

1. Select text
2. Click link icon or press Cmd+L (Mac) or Ctrl+L (Win/Linux)
3. Write link name inside **[**Google Search**]** and URL inside **(**http://google.com**)**

After you have closed markdown editor, only link name is shown.

In case selected text starts with a URL, editor selects link name to be written. In case plain text is select, editor guesses that you would like to type a URL.


Shape Link Indicator
--------------------

Links have been supported on a shape level for a quite long time, but there was no visual indicator, which element contains a link. You needed to open a shape context menu to see if it contained a link. Therefore now shape shows visual link indicator.

Link indicator works as a normal web page link. Use Cmd+Click to open link on a new browser tab, for now all main browsers except Firefox supports that behavior.
