What Sketchboard.io is?
-----------------------

Born from idea that today people are no longer working on a single location, still people want to solve problems and collaborate efficiently.

Idea is to **make a complex problem simple** and **communicate visually** by sketching on **web browser**. In a similar way as paper and pen  clarifies ideas for your self and how whiteboard helps teams to create ideas and communicate together.

When you sketch, you'll get good overall picture, **a map what you are about to do**. Team members understand objectives in a same way, scope is better understood and you'll get better structured end result faster.

Sketchboard.io is mainly **targeted** for people working with **software development**, software developers, architects, designers, testers and managers. But anyone who wants to create structured visual ideas can utilize it. There are various other user groups as well e.g. coaches, students, teachers and book writers.

## Troubleshooting

- In case you have created your own team before admin added you to the team.
