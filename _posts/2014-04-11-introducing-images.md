Happy to introduce images on Sketchboard. This has been one of the most requested features. Images can be now dragged and dropped on a board.

- first open a business board
- drag image from your desktop to the board

Images can be used as normal elements, connect and resize images as you wish. Uploaded images
are found from an image library. Image library is accessed through board context menu. 
Double click or long press board to open context menu and select image library.

Double click board => Board Context Menu => Select image library icon

<img src="/img/img-lib-select.png" alt="Board Context Menu" width="350">

Image library => Select image to be added on a board

<img src="/img/img-lib.png" alt="Image Library" width="350">

You can reuse images from the image library on different boards. Since images are automatically added to the library, you can remove images by clicking "Modify library". Library and board images are living separate lives, if you delete image from the library, image will be still kept on a board and vice versa.

Image upload from iPad is supported through "Upload Image" icon.

Example usages
--------------

### Whiteboard Image

You just had a good meeting with a potential solution on a whiteboard. Take a picture from the meeting room whiteboard. Upload image directly from your iPad and continue drawing on Sketchboard. You can draw freehand on top of it and export it as a new image.

Sketchboard can act as meeting minutes form your meeting or you can continue the work using Sketchboard.


### Comment Visual Design

You can upload image of a visual design e.g. of a web site. Add comments on top of the image and iterate design quickly and effortlessly.

Take e.g. screen shot from an existing user interface. Draw new feature on top of the image using Sketchboard freehand. Get comments directly with in the board.


Space Usage and Library Cleanup
-------------------------------

Image support is available only for business boards. Limitation is due to expenses coming from transferring and storing images on S3. This is not a backup for your images, but a very durable storage for your images.

Space is increased by 100 MB/user/account. If you have one person in the account, you have 100 MB for the library and for all board images. For two users it is 200 MB for the whole account, and so on.

### NOTE!
Due to expenses coming for storing images. There will be cleanup for the images. After business account has expired, you have 14 days to reactivate your account until images are removed from the account forever without possibility to recover those. Images will be shown as empty on boards that are using removed images.


Browser support
---------------

- Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE 11
- Images cannot be uploaded using IE9
