Accounts feature is a step towards supporting business users. 
Functionality makes boards by default private and those can be shared easily between account users.

Account
-------

Users in the account are divided to Admin and Members. 

- Account Admin -- add or remove users from account
- Account Member -- able to see all boards with account visibility
- Account User = Admin or Member -- able to see all boards with account visibility

Visibility
----------

- Private boards -- only you are able to open the board
- Accounts visibility -- all account users can see the boards
- Public boards shared with a password -- in case you need to share board addhoc to e.g. client or freelance collaborator. Share board with a password.

Sharing
-------

Changes to earlier Sketchboard.Me
---------------------------------

- for now it is not possible to share editable boards to others if they don't have a password


At some point it might be possible to make totally public boards related to an account. Those would be available through some listing. Then it could be possible to see public activity in Sketchboard.Me.
