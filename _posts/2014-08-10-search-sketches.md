Searching is important and Sketchboard used to lack on this front, but now this is changed. Now all board content is searchable. You can search boards by board name or search by board content. Search result shows board visually, so it is easier to find what you are looking for.

"Searching" Sketches Visually
-----------------------------

Now Sketchboard generates preview thumbnail for your boards. As one user told me, 


> The random identifiers makes it very difficult to remember which board is what if you forget to name the board.

Many times just the layout of the board brings to your mind, hey this was the board I was looking for. That is many times the power of visual notes and sketches. Layout of elements is already very important to flow structure and thoughts in to your mind.

Visual index of boards lets you change boards very quickly, especially if you use a shortcut. Click "Switch Board" and by default boards are listed in grid format. Sketchboard creates thumbnail for your business boards.

The Search Box
--------------

When you start to type search query in the search box, you will see boards that have name close to what you have typed. Sketchboard uses so called fuzzy search logic to find board names. In case you want to find terms from board content click "search Sketchboard" or just press enter. Then search finds exact word matches from your board content.

Sketchboard searches business boards where you are the owner or belong to the team that shared the board. Note, you cannot search boards that are shared to you with a password.


New Shortcut
------------

```
Mac OSX: Cmd + P
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + P
```

Shortcut is inspired by [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) editor and it overrides default browser print functionality.
