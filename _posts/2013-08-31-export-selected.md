From now on Sketchboard obeys selected elements when exporting a board. In case you have selected some elements from the board, exports obeys the selection. In case you don't select anything, full board will be exported.

### Steps
1. Select elements
2. Select export method, e.g. Print

### Export Only Selected Elements as PNG
